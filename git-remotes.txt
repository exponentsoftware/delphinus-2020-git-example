Git clone


ex: git clone <repostiry_url.git>

1) Git will initialize an empty repo in your localmachine
    git init
2) add the remote on your existing empty repo
    git remote add origin <repository_url>
3) pull all the latest changes on to my local machine
  git pull origin  



Case where i have already have a repo in my local and want to push it to a remote 
 1) I need create a remote repo (github/gitlab)
 2) add that newly created remote repo url as your remotes in your local
    git remote add origin <newly_created_repo_ulr.git>
 3) Push my changes to remote
   git push origin <branch-name>



Pull request.

1) work on a seperate branch other than master 
2) add , commit and push that branch to remote repo
3) make a pull request
4) merge / rebase.
